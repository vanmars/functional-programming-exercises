* Will need to check the length of starting number input
* Depending on what place an integer is in, it will be handled differently
* Need a function for ones, tens, hundreds, thousands
* Will need conditional statements: If in thosands place, will run thousands function, and then will need to get rid of that thousands place digit and run the central function again, so input number needs to be made into an array so we can shift the digit we are working with before re-running the central function.
